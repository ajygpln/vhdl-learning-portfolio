# vhdl-learning-portfolio

This repository documents my progress in learning VHDL, digital logic design, and FPGA fundamentals.  
It includes RTL design examples, behavioural and timing simulations, and testbench development using Vivado.

The goal of this portfolio is to build a strong foundation in hardware description languages and FPGA workflows while demonstrating consistent hands-on learning.
