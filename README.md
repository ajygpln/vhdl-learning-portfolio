# vhdl-learning-portfolio

This repository showcases my progress in learning VHDL, digital logic design, and FPGA development.  
It includes RTL examples, testbenches, and behavioural/timing simulations created while studying hardware design using Vivado.

My goals for this portfolio:
- Build a strong foundation in hardware description languages  
- Practice common digital logic components and modelling styles  
- Develop testbenches and simulation workflows  
- Prepare for future work and internships in digital/FPGA design  

Each project folder includes:
- `/src` – VHDL source files  
- `/tb` – testbenches  
- `/sim` – waveform screenshots or simulation logs  
- `README.md` – explanation of the design and results  

This repository is updated as I continue learning VHDL and RTL design.
